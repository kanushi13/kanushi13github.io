                Our Mission is to promote animal welfare and encourage adolescents to join this humanitarian cause
                and give them an opportunity to be part of their community.
            </p>
        <p class="about-us-info">From a young age, Victoria Li has always gravitated towards animals. 
            She loves to interact with animals she comes across, including her own dog, 
            while dreaming about being a veterinarian. This undying love carries over to her passion for 
            animal welfare, a cause that represents the values of
            compassion, responsibility, and respect. Subsequently, in December of 2022, Adolescents for Animals
            was created! Adolescents for Animals is a non-profit organization that looks to promote 
            animal wellbeing and ecourages adolescents to join this humane cause, all the while
            giving them an opportunity to be part of their community. Shortly after, she recruited 
            two individuals; Kali Bucklen and Shahzad Bolduc, both equally passionate about this cause.
             Through fundraisers and other public events, this organization works to reach, educate, and encourage as many people
              (specifically students) as much as possible in this humanitarian cause. The goal is to support other animal welfare 
            organizations, and benefit as many animals as we can by providing them safety and comfort. Although currently we work 
            in DelCo community, we hope to slowly spread our organization to the whole state of Pennsylvania, and in the future, to the 
            United States as a whole.</p>
